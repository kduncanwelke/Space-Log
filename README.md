# Space-Log
Record your journey!

This app acts as a journal, featuring a space-inspired design, multiple options for every entry, and an easy-to-use interface. It allows a user to record useful information, including notes, lists, links, reminders, location, and photos. Being multi-use, it can record any combination of the available options that a user desires. As a digital journal it keeps all information private to the user's device, and readily close at hand.

## Features
Space Log comes with a main view of the list of entries (referred to as 'logs), with a succinct view of title, content, and images that incidate included features (such as whether a list or location is associated with an entry). This view includes a search bar to find logs by title, content, or date.

Logs can be added or edited from a detail view, which consists of a scrollview to better incorporate all elements across all device sizes. This includes entry for text, selection of location, reminders, addition of images, an area to add an associated link, and a checklist (which acts as a to-do list). 

Log title and content can always be edited, but some content is required for both of these items. All the following items are optional.

Notifications allows a user to select a date and time and enter text, which will be displayed when the reminder (shown as a local notification) is activated. These reminders self-expire when they have been sent, but can be deleted earlier. 

A location can be added from a map tap or search, or by using the device's current location. A location can be changed or deleted once added.  

Photos can be added to entries, and also viewed full screen if tapped on. This feature allows a user to easily review multiple images they added, or share them with friends. Images can be deleted from this view too, if they are no longer desired.

Links are validated upon be added into the link area, and cannot be saved unless they are valid. This helps prevent against typos or mistakes the user might make on accident.

List items can be added, checked on or off, and deleted from their embedded table view. 

These varied features and their status as optional means the user can choose to customize entries to their needs, and include as little or as much as desired.

## Art
Unique space-themed art is used within the app, to enhance the space theme. This art was created by myself (the developer) and belongs to no one else.
